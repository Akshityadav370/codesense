## What is code sense?
Code Sense is an innovative web application that redefines the code debugging experience by harnessing the unparalleled capabilities of OpenAI APIs. Developed as a cutting-edge tool for software engineers, Code Sense aims to streamline and enhance the software development process. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models and advanced natural language processing techniques, Code Sense offers an intelligent, context-aware, and real-time code inspection solution.

The platform provides developers with a seamless and efficient way to upload their code and receive instant feedback. Through dynamic analysis, Code Sense comprehensively examines the codebase, pinpointing syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and potential runtime bugs. Additionally, the system offers context-sensitive suggestions for code optimization and adherence to coding standards, further improving the overall quality and efficiency of the code.

Code Sense integration into various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and code repositories allows it to become an indispensable companion for developers across a wide range of programming languages. By empowering developers with the capabilities of OpenAI APIs, Code Sense sets a new standard for code debugging tools, leading to more efficient development cycles and accelerating software project delivery.

The objective of the Code Sense project is to develop an intelligent Code Debugger Web Application that leverages the power of ReactJS and OpenAI APIs.
